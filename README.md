# Telco_customer_churn_using_logistic_regression

**Skills I learnt from this is:

1. matplotlib
2. pandas
3. sklearn

** How these skills helpful in future works

1. For analysing the data using descrptive stastics
2. In most of the cases data cleaning occupies the primary role. I am able to remove the outliers in dataset and able to handle the imbalanced dataset in realtime
